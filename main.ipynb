       "Mathematical imprints. How does mathematics make you feel? For many people, mathematics can seem forbidding, too hard, too cold, too abstract. That sense of dread may have started at school, especially when mathematics lessons were a matter of manipulating symbols and doing obscure calculations. Or it can be inherited or passed on by others. If people around you are talking about maths being difficult or pointless, you're very likely to think the same. And so lots of people drop mathematics as soon as they are able. What's the point of it, they ask. It doesn't seem relevant to anything you might need in the real world. Others, though, experience something like an intuitive understanding of mathematics which they nurture over time. Maths is difficult, yes, but these people embrace the challenge. They can see a beauty in mathematics that others sadly can't. Maybe they are interested in having a career which requires mathematical knowledge. They develop a love of the subject and are excited by the place it can lead them. Whether you are fearful of or fascinated by it, the history of mathematics will show you not only a difference, fa-- different face of mathematics, but exactly how and when it has been useful, how beautiful it is sometimes too. As we shall see, mathematics is not just about numbers, it is about being able to work out some kind of general rule and then how it can be applied to other situations. Mathematics develops skills that can solve problems of all kinds, mathematical or not. In this little book, you will find through learning about its history, many such examples of versatility of mathematics far beyond equations and arithmetic, from surface of the Earth all the way to the stars. Perhaps at some point you have seen some mathematical writing and not understood it. You wouldn't be the first. Rest assured, even professional mathematicians sometimes have to rely on discussions with colleagues to properly understand problems they are looking at. But how do you recognize some writing in mathematical in the first place? The complicated notation that might spring to mind, all those strange dashes, squiggles and letters are obvious signs, but as we shall see, a lot of that is really quite modern. Mathematics has been going on for a long time before the dashes and squiggles were invented. Put simply, there has to be something mathematical going on for us to say that it is mathematics. And if we are dealing with writing from a very distant past in a language that is not familiar to us, from a time even before recorded language, that can be sometimes difficult to recognize. Such was the problem faced by Belgian archaeologist Jean de Heinzelin de Brocourt when in the nineteen-thirties, he stumbled upon some ancient treasures near Lake Edward at Ishango, now in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Among the human remains and stone tools, he discovered a sharp-tipped baboon bone about the size of pencil, with strange etchings on its sides. Later excavations at the site uncovered more evidence, weapons, spears, and even some old ropes that proved this was a place where a prehistoric group of humans lived. The star of the show, though, remained the Ishango bone. But what was it? The six hundred sixty-- the one hundred sixty-eight etchings on its sides seemed mysterious, but suggested something more than mere decoration. Having to work things out from marks or symbols is often a good sign that what we are dealing with is mathematical, and so it proved. The Ishango bone turned out to be some kind of recording or counting device. The inscriptions on it were a form of mathematical statement. The etchings were organized into three parallel columns, each showing a different procedure, the doubling of values, listing prime number values between ten and twenty, and summing two values around the number twenty. Prime numbers are those you can only divide by one and themselves. As we shall see, they were first described around five hundred BCE, many centuries after the Ishango bone was made around twenty thousand years ago. Of course, some may say these marks were a happy accident, but they are just a little too organized to be the result of random scribbling.We now largely agree that the Ishango bone is the earliest mathematical object in the history of mathematics to have been discovered so far. To call an object mathematical, it has to be made or shaped by human effort or contain or refer to something mathematical. In an everyday sense, we would consider the Ishango bone or an abacus or a calculator all to be mathematical objects. But a mathematical object can even be an idea of an object. Not all mathematical objects, in other words, are those you can touch like this bone. Mathematicians nowadays call mathematical objects all the items we can either act on or do something to. For example, a point A, a line A, a number N are all such objects. These are abstract objects. When mathematicians refer to a point A, for example, they refer to a mathematical point with certain characteristics, perhaps its position, and not usually to a real point in a real space. We may therefore have stumbled upon our first difficulty, or perhaps we are getting closer to understanding what a mathematical object is. The Ishango bone is not an abstract object. It is a very real thing, but what it contains is quite abstract, and it refers to some knowledge we can certainly call mathematical. Its unique inscription show the first counting system of the kind recorded by humans. That is what makes it mathematical. Does mathematics exist independently of us? Mathematical laws and rules are somehow inscribed in nature and the universe. Some animals appear to behave mathematically. For instance, magpies can tell the difference between five and six objects. Chimpanzees can ga-- give a nod to the fact that five is more than four. And let's not forget the bees crafting perfect hexagons, or ants who are quite capable of spotting ex-exits from enclosed spaces. But this seeming mathematical ability is no more than recognition, instinct, and inbuilt behavior. They don't, in other words, build on that behavior further. Bees don't connect their honeycomb structure with ideas about the best way to pack things in general. That was done, as we will see, by a twentieth-century mathematician. They just do it. We human always try to make things better, and when we manage to do something well, we still seek to improve it. Sometimes that leads us to places where what we imagine and structure with mathematics is not possible to reconcile with our real-- reality. This is very different to what bees and, as far as we know, any other animals do. For over two millennia, humans have built on their knowledge of recogni-recognizing patterns and connecting them with other patterns. Now we can use mathematics to postulate many more dimensions than the three we live in. With mathematics, we are able to make predictions in seemingly chaotic behaviors that occur in all sorts of fields, from nature to economics. We have developed abstract structures of mathematics so high that if you stood on them and looked back at the Ishango bone, you would feel quite dizzy. And we continually push that knowledge on. We have just touched on some of the things that make up the two branches of mathematics, pure and applied. In pure mathematics, we make abstract conclusions. This sort of maths includes number theory, geometry, algebra, analysis, all of which we will find out more about later in this book. What we learn from pure mathematics, we may not use immediately or ever directly. Sometimes we wait for centuries before we can we-- where we can use such knowledge in a practical way. Applied mathematics, on the other hand, comes usually from some problems we want to solve in real life, and we would usually use such mathematics in real life more or less immediately. Applied mathematics is involved with questions and problems that arise from other disciplines such as physics or engineering, computing, biology, economics, you name it. And it also contributes to the developments in these disciplines. One thing pure and applied mathematics have in common is the formulating of rules and their way of making generalizations. If applied mathematics can help make sense of the patterns of majestic whales and their mesmerizing aquatic dances across the vast oceans, pure mathematicians are like deep sea divers immersing themselves in the fascinating world of ideas just for the joy of itBut even when this world doesn't seem to have anything to do with our everyday experience, they are keen to describe its laws and structures. And through the history of mathematics, be it pure or applied, we can follow such adve-adventures from a distance, yet still share in awe and wonder of their discovery. Humans in different times and places have always glimpsed new things and come up with new ideas, recorded them and played with them, and so created new mathematics. It's like language. Just as we can bend words to our will in creating astonishing new poetry while retaining enough linguistic structure to the comprehensible, so too we continuously update and originate new mathematics out of that which we inherited. This is another reason that the history of mathematics is important. Looking at successive breakthroughs in the field, we can learn of the crucial axes upon which mathematics as a whole has been founded and the turns it has taken on its journey of development. We can see the dynamic dance of mathematical ideas between peoples far away from each other, not only in space but in time too. Through the mathematics they, they write universal dialogues develop and problems that were posed in one century may be solved in another. Mathematicians are always answering questions of today by building on what has been discovered yesterday"
